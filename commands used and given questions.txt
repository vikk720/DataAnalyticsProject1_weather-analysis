The commands that we used in this project :

* head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).
* shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe
* index - This attribute provides the index of the dataframe
* columns - It shows the name of each column
* dtypes - It shows the data-type of each column
* unique() - In a column, it shows all the unique values. It can be applied on a single column only, not on the whole dataframe.
* nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
* count - It shows the total no. of non-null values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
* value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only.
* info() - Provides basic information about the dataframe.
